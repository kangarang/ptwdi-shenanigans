Reddit is not the same as it was 10 years ago, but it still is one of the best resources for keeping up with modern programming knowledge. I've still to find my niche in the programming world, but any time I find something that interests me, I save/bookmark it so that I can refer back to it later. Here are some reddit posts I've saved over the last year I've been a developer. Hope you find them useful!
