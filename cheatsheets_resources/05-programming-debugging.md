# Programming / Debugging
### The Computer
- The computer does not assume.
- The computer follows commands **blindly** and **stupidly**.
- But the computer follows them **really well**.

If you tell the computer to do something, it will do it. If you accidentally make a typo, the computer will do its best to execute whatever weird command you told it to do.

One typo can break a command, so there's a whole lot of room for **error**.

## How to debug / problem solve / get help
- THINK before you start coding.

- Plan out what you're going to code on a piece of paper / whiteboard first.

- Make sure syntax, formatting, indentation is written correctly.

- Refer to the lecture slides and cheatsheets.

- **Get used to the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/)** -- MDN is the de facto reference that all roads eventually lead to.

- **READ THE ERROR MESSAGES**

- Google & Stackoverflow.

- Slack shenanigans-main channel / questions channel.

- When asking for help, provide as much information about your problem as possible. This will help solve your problem faster.
    - What are you trying to accomplish?
    - What error messages are you seeing?
    - Provide a snippet of your code
    - What else have you tried?

- HTML elements are rectangles, so when thinking about how to structure your page, imagine a rectangular border around each of the elements. Think of this border as a sort of "container". This container is essentially the HTML element tag that the content is "wrapped" in.

- The quickest way to visualize an HTML element is to put a border around it -- `border: 1px solid black;` -- this is great for testing and debugging.

- Use the Chrome Inspector. You can even right click directly on an html element click `inspect` to so that specific element.
