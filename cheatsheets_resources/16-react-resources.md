​i​ like using react cause it feels like javascript and not html. ​i​m just gonna vomit a bunch of resources down below. ​f​or pretty much all of them, ​i​ haven’t taken a look at fully. ​i​ just love hoarding resources lol. hope you find them helpful!


This [egghead.io tutorial](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-react-fundamentals-development-environment-setup) was awesome when I was first starting out.

This is a great article about [thinking in react](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html).

By the way, I highly recommend using react WITHOUT redux until you get the hang of `setState`. Redux makes sense when your app starts to grow huge and requires a whole lot of state. The saying goes, “If you’re not sure you need redux, you probably don’t”.

Styling in react can actually be kind of a pain in the ass. Inline styles are the fastest method, but definitely not the most elegant. [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) is a great library and I think it’s pretty much the industry standard at the moment. here’s a link with [some examples](https://www.sitepoint.com/style-react-components-styled-components/).

Here’s a list of resources: [react-redux-links](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links)

Another list of resources: [awesome-react](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react)

Here’s a best practices repo: [react-bits](https://github.com/vasanthk/react-bits)

Here’s a set of useful components: [react-toolbox](https://github.com/react-toolbox/react-toolbox)

Once I got the hang of react, I studied this boilerplate to see how the pros architect their apps: [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate)

Here’s another boilerplate: [react-starter-kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit)

Here’s a [tutorial on how to connect a react frontend to an existing node app](https://daveceddia.com/create-react-app-express-backend/)
